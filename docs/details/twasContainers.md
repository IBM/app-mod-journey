# Deploy a Simple application to tWAS Base in Containers

 - tWAS Base in Containers is provided as a stepping stone to modernizing to Liberty
 - It delivers significantly fewer advantages of containerization than modernizing to Liberty, however it also typically requires significantly less (or even zero) development effort 
     - You can compare your modernization targets [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cta?topic=started-modernization-target-comparison)
     - You will see far more green ticks (aka good things) when modernizing to Liberty
 - The processing of deploying to tWAS Base in Containers follows the same flow as deploying to Liberty
 - The main difference is that in this flow you will use the Runtime Component Operator instead of a Liberty Operator
