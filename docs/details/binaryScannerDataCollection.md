# Using the Binary Scanner

 - What we refer to as the binary scanner (because it scans the binary code) is shorthand for its official title: The WebSpHere Application Migration Toolkit. 
 - The main reason you would run this (instead of running the full Data Collector) is that you can download and use it now without needing to install Transformation Advsior
   - To get the best out of the results we **strongly recommend** that you still install Transformation Advisor
 - If you want to see some results now, and don't currently have the resources/permissions/time to download and install Transformation Advisor, then this is a good option
   - Install of TA Local on a Linux system (or your laptop/mac) that has either podman or docker takes **only 10 minutes** - [download here](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6958773/)
