# Scanning with User Defined Rules 

 - Since the release of Transformation Advisor v2.5 you can define your own custom analysis rules to detect scenarios specific to your application migration. 
 - The user-defined rules can be easily created as described [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wamt?topic=binaries-user-defined-rules) 
 - The results will display in Transformation Advisor UI in the same manner as the pre-written rules that come out of the box. 
 - The configuration files for User Defined Rules in Transformation Advisor are located in <DC_HOME>/conf/userDefinedRules
